<p> Hello,
my name is Cameron Lovejoy, I am a Sophomore here at Umaine. I originally attended Saint Joesph's College in Standish, ME where I played basketball and majored in Communications. I transferred after my first semester because it felt as if I was still in high school due to the small enrollment. I have switched my major to Marketing with a minor in Economics. For this class, to be honest, I have no idea what to expect. So far it has been a wonderful class and seems interesting. I'm excited to learn more about the curriculum and possibly having this as my concentration! </p>
